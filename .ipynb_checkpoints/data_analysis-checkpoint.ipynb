    "All of that being said, the United States has a long history of undermining this fundamental value from only allowing certain citizens to vote to modern day voter suppression laws, from having a first-pass-the-post voting system to not making election day a national holiday. However of those of concerns and more, the one concern I would like to focus on relates to campaign spending and the possible side effects of the Supreme Court ruling FEC v Citizens United. \n",

    "For the time being, I will only consider spending by the candidate's principal committee (i.e. Joe Smith for Congress). At a later date, I would like to include other committess who's aim it is to elect a specific candidate such as PAC committees, Joint committees, and ultimately Independent Expenditure-Only committess (aka Super-PACs).
